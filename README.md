# P2654Languages
Sandbox to experiment with various proposals for description DSLs for this standard and P1687.1

The STAM (System Test Access Manager) directory experiments with a description language patterned after the IEEE 1687 Instrument Connectivity Language (ICL).  The syntax is similar, but the semantics is quite different as the behavior is abstracted to the associated library plug-ins.
